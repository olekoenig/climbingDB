# Notes:

This current version requires only the scripts main.py,
climbingQuery.py and grade.py. The object orientated implementation of
Route, Ascent, and Location is currently unused.

In the future I plan on switching to an SQL database instead of
reading a csv file. Then, these scripts will become of importance.
