# Notes:

This current version requires only the scripts main.py,
climbingQuery.py and grade.py.

# Ideas:

- upload picture of multipitch, click on belays and store in database
- routes over time
- "most successful days"
- integrate GPS, where to park, crag info --> parse CSV file and extract crags
